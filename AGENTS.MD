# AGENTS

## Release policy (pre-1.0.0)
- Until any package reaches 1.0.0, we do not follow semver; all releases default to **patch**.
- Do not create minor or major releases unless explicitly instructed by the maintainer.
- If a major update is requested, follow the maintainer’s explicit release classification instructions.
